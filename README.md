# Oscar-Winning-Recipe
A data analysis project about the characteristics of Oscar winning movies.
_____________________________________________________________________________

## Introduction
By researching some characteristics of past Oscar winning movies (and nominees), I deducted what is needed for a movie to have higher chances of winning such an award.

**The ones checked are:** Budget, income, genre, language, popularity, rating and runtime.

Some were found to have no connection to said subject whatsoever, while some were inpactful.

## Conclusions
An Oscar winning movie is one that:
1. Rating: Is rated high, between 7 to 9, not less and not more.
2. Runtime: Is usually about 2 to 3 hours long - long films.
3. Budget: The budget invested in the production is either very large or small, not average.
4. Income: Has large income - the more, the better.
5. Target audience: The target audience is mainly young people.
6. Genre: Mainly adventure and biography.
